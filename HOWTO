# BlackMagicBox receives payments and forwards them to the address
# specified as a parameter. 
# It can use the mainnet or the testnet
# It cannot yet use the regtest network as it requires a full client
# in the localhost. This would be desirable if we want to observe all 
# calls without the noise generated by the network


# It does not open any door for now, as the interface to the piface board
# is not yet integrated in BlackMagicBox

#  compile BlackMagicBox:

$ make 

# Run BlockMagicBox
# > java -cp <classpath> BlockMagicBox AddressToFowardCoins testnet|mainnet

# mjYfd4khBukNe5NwgUQ1iRZ4hJrRutpAtz is an address of Enrique's BitcoinTestnet Wallet
# slf4 contains functions to log. It fails back to nothing if not found

$ make run

# You should see something like this:
# Note that the received coins are forwarded even if the transaction is not yet confirmed
# this works with no problem. We are responsible of not spending twice, which should not 
# happen as wallets are different for each Box
